<h1 class="faq-title">Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

<div class="faq-item">
<button class="faq-question">1. Can medication completely relieve tooth pain?</button>
<div class="faq-answer">
Not entirely. While medications may offer short-term relief, long-lasting relief requires identifying and 
treating the root cause of the pain through professional dental care. 
</div>
</div>

<div class="faq-item">
<button class="faq-question">2. Does teeth scaling cause enamel damage, sensitivity, or gaps between teeth? </button>
<div class="faq-answer">
No. Scaling safely removes plaque and tartar from teeth and below the gum line. It doesn’t damage 
enamel or create gaps. Some temporary sensitivity may occur, but it usually subsides as gums heal and 
reattach to the teeth.
</div>
</div>

<div class="faq-item">
<button class="faq-question">3. Can fluorosis stains be removed through scaling? </button>
<div class="faq-answer">
Scaling can remove surface (extrinsic) stains but not fluorosis, which is an internal (intrinsic) stain. 
Fluorosis may require treatments like bleaching, veneers, or crowns for cosmetic improvement. 
</div>
</div>

<div class="faq-item">
<button class="faq-question">4.  Can painful teeth be treated with fillings? </button>
<div class="faq-answer">
Not always. If the cavity has reached the pulp, the innermost layer of the tooth, simple filling won’t help. 
In such cases, root canal treatment or tooth extraction might be necessary. Fillings are effective only when 
the damage is limited to the outer layers (enamel and dentin). 
</div>
</div>

<div class="faq-item">
<button class="faq-question">5.. Is placing a cap or crown necessary after root canal treatment (RCT)?</button>
<div class="faq-answer">
Yes. A crown is recommended after RCT to protect the treated tooth, which may be weaker due to decay. 
It prevents fractures and adds durability, especially during chewing.
</div>
</div>


<div class="faq-item">
<button class="faq-question">6.Can milk teeth need root canal treatment (RCT)? </button>
<div class="faq-answer">
Yes. If a milk tooth has a deep cavity and is likely to remain in the mouth for some time, an RCT can 
preserve it and prevent infection or early loss.
</div>
</div>

<div class="faq-item">
<button class="faq-question">7. How can I maintain good oral hygiene? </button>
<div class="faq-answer">
Brush your teeth twice daily with proper technique, rinse after meals, floss regularly, and schedule 
routine check-ups with your dentist to maintain healthy teeth and gums.
</div>
</div>
<div class="faq-item">
<button class="faq-question">8.What is the best age to get braces?</button>
<div class="faq-answer">
Braces are most effective between ages 12 and 14, when the jaw and teeth are still developing. However, 
some cases may benefit from earlier intervention depending on the condition.
</div>
</div>
<div class="faq-item">
<button class="faq-question">9. Do all wisdom teeth need to be removed?</button>
<div class="faq-answer">
No. Wisdom teeth only require removal if they are impacted, infected, or causing pain due to crowding 
or damage to adjacent teeth. 
</div>
</div>
<div class="faq-item">
<button class="faq-question">10.Is it important to replace missing teeth after extraction? </button>
<div class="faq-answer">
Yes. Replacing extracted teeth helps maintain proper bite alignment and prevents adjacent teeth from 
shifting, which can affect chewing and overall oral function. 
</div>
</div>
<div class="faq-item">
<button class="faq-question">11. What are the benefits of dental implants? </button>
<div class="faq-answer">
Dental implants restore both the appearance and functionality of missing teeth. They provide a stable, 
natural-looking solution that can improve confidence and overall quality of life.
</div>
</div>
<div class="faq-item">
<button class="faq-question">12.Which type of toothbrush and toothpaste should I use? </button>
<div class="faq-answer">
Use a soft or medium-bristled toothbrush with a small head for better reach. Choose a non-abrasive 
fluoride toothpaste and replace your toothbrush every three months for optimal hygiene. 
</div>
</div>

<div class="faq-item">
<button class="faq-question">13. What causes tooth sensitivity?</button>
<div class="faq-answer">
Tooth sensitivity can result from enamel wear (due to attrition or abrasion), tooth decay, exposed tooth 
roots, or hairline cracks in the teeth. 
</div>
</div>

<div class="faq-item">
<button class="faq-question">14.How often should I see a dentist? </button>
<div class="faq-answer">
Visiting your dentist every six months is recommended for routine check-ups, professional cleaning, and 
preventive care to maintain good oral health.
